## Recommended Contribution Levels

Based on the statistical analysis, here are recommended PR contribution levels for different team member roles:

### 1. Team Member (General)
**Recommended: 10-20 PRs/year**

- Represents median to upper-regular contribution level
- Achievable for part-time or sponsored contributors
- Approximately 1-2 PRs per month
- Above the 50th percentile (11 PRs/year)

### 2. Active Team Member
**Recommended: 20-50 PRs/year**

- Represents the 75th percentile range
- Shows sustained engagement with the project
- Approximately 2-4 PRs per month
- Accounts for ~22% of all contributor-years

### 3. Core Team Member
**Recommended: 50-100 PRs/year**

- Top 10% of all contributors
- Likely full-time or heavily sponsored work
- Approximately 4-8 PRs per month
- Significant architectural and maintenance work

### 4. Team Lead/Maintainer
**Recommended: 100+ PRs/year**

- Top 5% of contributors
- Full-time dedicated role
- 8+ PRs per month
- Project leadership and vision

## Context and Quality Considerations

### Important Factors

**Quality vs. Quantity:**
- Large architectural changes may result in fewer but more impactful PRs
- Bug fixes and small improvements generate higher PR volume
- Documentation PRs are equally valuable
- Code review participation matters (not captured in PR metrics)

**Realistic Baseline:** **12-15 PRs/year**
- Above the median (11 PRs/year)
- Achievable and meaningful participation
- Approximately 1-2 PRs per month
- Reasonable for ~10-20% time allocation

### Minimum Viable Contribution

**6-10 PRs/year**
- Shows active participation in the project
- Approximately 1 PR every 1-2 months
- Keeps contributor engaged with the codebase
- Aligns with "Regular" contributor category

### Expected Active Member

**15-25 PRs/year**
- Above median, meaningful contribution
- Approximately 2 PRs per month
- Balances quality and consistency
- Strong team member engagement

## Special Observations

### The Occasional Contributor Group (35%)

- 35.4% of all contributor-years fall in the 1-5 PRs/year range
- These are often specialists who contribute when needed
- Valuable for specific expertise and review
- Should not be dismissed as "inactive"

### Exceptional Contributors

**sneridagh (Víctor Fernández de Alba):**
- 203.4 PRs/year average over 8 years
- Clearly a full-time Volto Team Lead role
- Consistent leadership across all years

**stevepiercy (Steve Piercy):**
- 53.0 PRs/year average over 5 years
- Documentation specialist
- High-quality, focused contributions

### Long-Term Consistency

- 18 members have contributed for 5+ years
- Long-term engagement is a key indicator of team health
- Sustained contribution matters more than peak performance

## Recommendations

### For Team Management

1. **Set flexible expectations:** Use 10-20 PRs/year as a baseline, not a rigid rule
2. **Value consistency:** Prefer steady contributions over sporadic bursts
3. **Consider quality:** Large refactorings and architectural work may mean fewer PRs
4. **Recognize documentation:** Documentation PRs are as valuable as code
5. **Account for roles:** Different roles (maintainer vs. contributor) have different expectations

### For Team Members

1. **Minimum engagement:** Aim for 6-10 PRs/year to stay actively involved
2. **Active participation:** Target 15-25 PRs/year for meaningful contribution
3. **Focus on impact:** Quality and architectural improvements matter more than volume
4. **Stay consistent:** Regular small contributions beat irregular large ones
5. **Contribute broadly:** Code, docs, reviews all count

### For New Team Members

1. **Ramp-up period:** 5-10 PRs in first year is reasonable
2. **Learn the codebase:** Focus on understanding before volume
3. **Start with issues:** Tackle good first issues and documentation
4. **Ask questions:** Engage with the community through reviews and discussions

- **Time Period:** 2017-01-01 to 2025-12-31

## Conclusion

The Volto team shows healthy contribution patterns with:

- **Strong leadership:** Clear leads (sneridagh, stevepiercy) driving the project
- **Solid core team:** 8-10 members with 5+ years of consistent contribution
- **Diverse participation:** Mix of full-time and part-time contributors

- Being achievable for part-time contributors
- Allowing for quality over quantity
- Maintaining long-term sustainability
