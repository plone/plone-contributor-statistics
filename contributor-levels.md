**Recruitment:**
- 7 new contributors (1 year) at Team level
- Need pathways to Active and Core

- **4 Leads** (100+ PRs/yr) - Full-time, leadership roles
- **5 Core** (50-99 PRs/yr) - Significant commitment

- **20 Team** (10-19 PRs/yr) - Regular participation

**Key insights:**
1. **37% contribute to both Plone and Volto** - strong integration
2. **0% are Volto-only** - confirms Volto is part of Plone ecosystem
3. **49% have 6 years sustained contribution** - healthy core
4. **Top 9 (18%) drive most development** - concentration risk
5. **14 new contributors (1-3 years)** - recruitment working

**The recommended framework successfully identifies meaningful contributors across the ecosystem while accounting for the structural differences between Plone's 300+ repos and Volto's single repository.**
